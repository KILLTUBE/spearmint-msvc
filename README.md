# spearmint-msvc

Currently works: engine, game, cgame, rend1, all you need to play nicely

The solution starts `spearmint_x86.exe` with these arguments: `+set vm_cgame 0 +set vm_game 0 +set sv_pure 0 +set bot_enable 0`

The `vm_` stuff makes it use the .dll's

todo:
 * add rend2 project
 * fix qvm, its crashing for some reason
 * fix bots, crashing for some other reason
 * awesome mods
